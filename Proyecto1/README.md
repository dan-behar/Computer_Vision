## Proyecto1
This project was aimed to create a car plate detector that can recognize a plate and the letters

* LicencePlates: all the Belgium car plates used for the project
* model.ipynb: the jupyter notebook in which I created, trained and exported the model. The file "model.sav" was too big to be uploaded to Github, so I didn't upload it
* script.ipynb: the jupyter notebook where I developed the main program previous the .py file
* For the model, I extracted the training letters from this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aladdinss/license-plate-digits-classification-dataset/data) and I stored in a directory called **model_images**
