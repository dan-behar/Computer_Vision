## Lab1
In this exercise we painted all the lines in a fingerprint using the Conected Components Algorithm

* Script.ipynb: the notebook in which I tested and created the project
* fprint3.pgm: the image of the fingerprint
* laboratorio_1.py: the jupyter notebook as a Python File in order to allow me run the hole program at once
